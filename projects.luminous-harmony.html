          <h3>Brief Overview:</h3>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Luminous Harmony is a showcase of innovative lighting design
            implemented at the prestigious Riverfront Hotel in Chicago. This
            project was designed to create an ambiance that complements the
            luxurious interior while enhancing the architectural features of the
            hotel. Our approach centered on blending traditional aesthetics with
            modern lighting technology. We used advanced LED solutions to
            highlight the hotel's grand architecture, ensuring that each area
            received its own thematic lighting that shifts with the mood and
            time of day. Ambient, task, and accent lighting techniques were
            employed to enhance both functionality and ambiance. The main
            lobby's lighting was designed to adapt from a bright, welcoming
            day-time setting to a more subdued, intimate evening atmosphere.
            Special weather-resistant fixtures were used for outdoor areas,
            emphasizing durability without compromising on style.
